	<!-- 
		Notice that we are aliasing the view-model as "appController". Behind
		the scenes, this is doing nothing more than setting up the following
		scope-level binding:

		$scope.appController = {{ controller-instance }}
	-->
	<div ng-controller="AppController as appController">

		<p>
			<a ng-click="appController.incrementFoo()">Increment Foo</a>: 
			{{ appController.fooCount }}.
